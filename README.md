# ChatBot 

**This is a simple Flask chatbot application that utilizes the ChatterBot library for generating responses to user input. The application allows users to interact with the chatbot through a web interface, and also includes a "teach" function that allows users to add new training data to the chatbot's knowledge base. The application code is written in Python 3 and is hosted locally using the Flask web framework. This project serves as a useful starting point for building your own chatbot application using Flask and ChatterBot.** : )
